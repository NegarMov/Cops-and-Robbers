# Cops and Robbers
My FP midterm project. There is one robber and some station houses. Each station holds some cops and the cops try to catch the robber. In case the robber comes in their vision they move towards him and report his location to the cops of the same station. The robber also tries to run away when a cop comes into his vision. Unless, their moves are random.
